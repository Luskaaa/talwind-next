# Tailwind CSS Study Project

This project is a personal study environment for learning and experimenting with **Tailwind CSS**. The main focus is on practicing Tailwind's utility classes, layouts, and responsive design techniques. **Next.js** is used as a supporting framework to organize the project, but is not the primary focus.

## Project Purpose

- Practice and explore Tailwind CSS features
- Experiment with layouts, components, and responsive design
- Use Next.js as a convenient way to structure and serve the project
- Build example UI elements such as sidebars, navigation, widgets, and profile sections

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Project Structure

- `app/components/Sidebar/` — Example sidebar navigation, widgets, and profile section
- `app/globals.css` — Tailwind CSS imports and global styles

## Notes
